          Task represents a collection of sequential steps that are run as part of a
          Pipeline using a set of inputs and producing a set of outputs. Tasks execute
          when TaskRuns are created that provide the input parameters and resources and
          output resources the Task requires.

                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                            recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made

                            supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                            an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                        Workspaces is a list of workspaces from the Task that this Sidecar wants
                        exclusive access to. Adding a workspace to this list means that any
                        other Step or Sidecar that does not also request this Workspace will
                        not have access to it.

                      description: |-
                        Optional marks a Workspace as not being required in TaskRuns. By default
                        this field is false and so declared workspaces are required.

                    readOnly:
                      description: |-
                        ReadOnly dictates whether a mounted volume is writable. By default this
                        field is false and so mounted volumes are writable.
